    I just want to say how truly thankful I am for you.
    For every good thing you've done for me â€” for taking care of me, for loving me so completely, and for being patient even on the days I struggle to love myself.

    You deserve this flower â€” not just any flower, but one full of love, warmth, and everything beautiful, just like your soul.

    You are my safe place. My home. And in every choice you make, please know that I am â€” and always will be â€” your first and biggest supporter.

    Here's a flower that will never wither, just like my love for you.

    Thank you for making love feel like peace.
    Thank you for existing.

    Forever yours,  
    LOVE ðŸŒ¸
